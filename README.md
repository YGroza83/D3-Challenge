You need to create a scatter plot between two of the data variables `Healthcare vs. Poverty`.
Using the D3 techniques create a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. You'll code this graphic in the `app.js` file of your directoryâ€”make sure you pull in the data from `data.csv` by using the `d3.csv` function. Your scatter plot should ultimately appear like the image at the top of this section.
* Include state abbreviations in the circles.
* Create and situate your axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.
